## About PhiZone

Note: Some charts do not have data.file(ChartFileUrl), these charts cannot be loaded.

Also, phigrim chart format is not supported yet.

## About URL parameters

`skip_config`:If this parameter is set to true, the chart renderer will immediately start playing after loading.

`chart_url`:If this parameter is set, the chart renderer will load the chart from the specified URL(Must be ZIP format and no CORS).

`phizone_url`:If this parameter is set, the chart renderer will load the chart from the PhiZone.

If Both `chart_url` and `phizone_url` are set, the chart renderer will load the chart from the specified URL first.

## About Moving to PIXI v8/Support of WebGPU

As moving to PIXI v8 is a huge mission, I'm not going to do it now.
